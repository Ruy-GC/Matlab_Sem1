# Matlab_Simulations
Matlab simulations from my first Semester in college.

simulador.m: simulation of the trajectory followed by a proyectile after being launched by a volcano eruption, this path is calculated by using the verlet method considering air resistance, height, initial speed, angle of the proyectile and its properties.

SimulacionPistaFormula1.m: this simulation presents a curve section of a F1 circuit considering the safety of the spectators and the drivers by designing the section using third grade ecuations, considering curve radius, maximum speed, superelevation angle and friction of the surface. This is to make sure that the trajectories that a car will follow in case of getting of track at the most dangerous points of the section do not represent any danger to the public.
